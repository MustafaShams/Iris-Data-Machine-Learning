# Iris-Data-Machine-Learning
Using different machine learning algorithms in python jupyter notebooks on the iris dataset. 
### Assignment 1. Lp Distance Function
Implemented python libraries to visual iris data as scatter plots, box plots, and histograms. Implemented the Lp distance function between 2 vectors. 
### Assignment 2. Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors
Implemented linear regression and gradient descent on the iris data to find the best lines to fit the data. Also implemented K-Nearest Neighbors and found the ideal nearest neighbors that has the most average accurate predictions for the iris type in the dataset. Then I found the best features to use to predict the nearest neighbors most accurately.  
### Assignment 3. K-Means Clustering
Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm on the iris dataset, plotted the clusters on a scatterplot, and tested the uniformity of each iris type in each cluster.
